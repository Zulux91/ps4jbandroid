pOOBs4 PS4 exploit for v9.0 + automatic gold hen android app

# About
This is an android app that creates a http server and serves the pOOBs4 exploit. After the exploit is loaded the GoldHen payload is sent automatically.

All credit to the team behind pOOBs4 and leeful (https://github.com/Leeful/leeful.github.io) for the host files (with caching) which I used to create the app.

# Setup

2. Install on android device
3. Connect your android device and PS4 to the same WiFi
4. Click "Start Server" and enter the address that's written above the button on the browser on your PS4 to run the exploit
